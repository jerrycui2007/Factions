# Factions
A math game where you calculate fractions. Two teams take turns answering increasingly difficult fraction arithmetic questions, and gain/lose points based on their answer.

I made this game by myself in sixth grade, for an open-ended math assignment. I used Tkinter for the GUI.

At the time, I added a condition where as long as your answer was within a certain range of the actual answer, it would be counted as correct. I plan to remove that sometime soon. I also wanted to add more features but never got around to doing it, so there are a lot of empty functions/features.
